### Hello There! 👋

I'm Hayden, a software engineering student who loves coding/math. My primary interest is creating software that revolves around communities and improves everyday life.

My current biggest focuses are:

- 🚀  &nbsp; Space systems research with [CoDe-Lab](http://code-lab.org/)
- 💻  &nbsp; Organizing hackathons (recently [Hoboken Climate Hack](https://hobokenclimate.com))
