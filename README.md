### Hello There! 👋

I'm Hayden, a software engineering student who loves coding/math. My primary interest is creating software that revolves around communities and improves everyday life.

My current biggest focuses are:

- 🐭 Dev at Disney Television Animation
- 📱 Building [exire.ai](https://exire.ai)
- 🚀 Space systems research with [CoDe-Lab](http://code-lab.org/)
- 💻 Organizing hackathons (recently [COVID HealthHack](https://covidhealthhack.com))
